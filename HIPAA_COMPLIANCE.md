# HIPAA Compliance Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the HIPAA compliance features implemented in the Caring AI application to ensure the protection of Protected Health Information (PHI).

## Security Features Implemented

### 1. Authentication & Authorization
- **HTTP-Only Cookies**: Authentication tokens are stored in secure HTTP-only cookies, preventing XSS attacks
- **Secure Cookie Settings**: Cookies are configured with `secure`, `sameSite`, and `httpOnly` flags
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Users are assigned specific roles with defined permissions
- **Session Management**: Automatic session timeout and secure session handling
- **Password Security**: Strong password requirements with bcrypt hashing (12 rounds)

### 2. Data Encryption
- **Field-Level Encryption**: Sensitive data is encrypted using AES-256-GCM encryption
- **Transport Security**: HTTPS enforcement in production
- **Database Encryption**: Sensitive fields are encrypted before storage
- **Key Management**: Secure encryption key handling and rotation

### 3. Audit Logging
- **Comprehensive Logging**: All user actions are logged with timestamps
- **Encrypted Audit Data**: Sensitive information in audit logs is encrypted
- **Retention Policy**: Audit logs are retained for 7 years (2555 days)
- **Security Event Monitoring**: Failed login attempts and security events are monitored

### 4. Access Controls
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against brute force attacks
- **IP Monitoring**: Suspicious activity monitoring
- **Session Timeout**: Automatic logout after inactivity
- **Multi-Factor Authentication Ready**: Framework for MFA implementation

### 5. Data Protection
- **Input Sanitization**: All user inputs are sanitized to prevent injection attacks
- **XSS Protection**: Content Security Policy and input validation
- **CSRF Protection**: SameSite cookie configuration
- **Data Minimization**: Only necessary data is collected and stored

## Technical Implementation

### Server-Side Security
```javascript
// HTTP-Only Cookie Configuration
const cookieOptions = {
    httpOnly: true,
    secure: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production',
    sameSite: 'strict',
    maxAge: 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000, // 24 hours
    path: '/'
};

// Field Encryption
const encryptedData = encrypt(sensitiveData);

// Audit Logging
await AuditLog.create({
    userId: encrypt(userId),
    action: 'LOGIN_SUCCESS',
    ip: req.ip,
    timestamp: new Date()
});
```

### Frontend Security
```javascript
// Cookie-based Authentication
const response = await fetch('/api/auth/login', {
    credentials: 'include', // Include cookies
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify(credentials)
});

// Session Timeout Management
const sessionTimeout = 30 * 60 * 1000; // 30 minutes
```
