# HIPAA Compliance for Patient Management System

## Overview
This document outlines the HIPAA compliance features implemented specifically for the Patient Management System in the Caring AI application.

## Patient Data Protection

### 1. Data Encryption
- **Field-Level Encryption**: All PHI (Protected Health Information) fields are encrypted using AES-256-GCM encryption
- **Encrypted Fields**: Name, Email, Contact Number, Age, Date of Birth, Gender, Address, Medical History, Emergency Contact
- **Key Management**: Secure encryption key handling with environment variable configuration
- **Transport Security**: All data transmission uses HTTPS in production

### 2. Access Controls
- **Authentication Required**: All patient endpoints require valid authentication tokens
- **Role-Based Permissions**: Users must have specific permissions to access patient data
  - `patients:read` - View patient information
  - `patients:create` - Add new patients
  - `patients:update` - Modify patient records
  - `patients:delete` - Deactivate patient records
- **Session Management**: Automatic session timeout and secure cookie handling

### 3. Audit Logging
- **Comprehensive Logging**: All patient data access is logged with:
  - User ID and timestamp
  - Action performed (CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE)
  - Patient ID (encrypted)
  - IP address and user agent
- **Access Tracking**: Each patient record tracks:
  - Last access time
  - Access count
  - Last modified by user
- **Audit Trail**: 7-year retention policy for all audit logs

### 4. Data Minimization
- **Required Fields Only**: Only necessary patient information is collected
- **JSON Filtering**: Sensitive system fields are excluded from API responses
- **Soft Deletion**: Patient records are deactivated rather than permanently deleted

### 5. Consent Management
- **Consent Tracking**: Patient consent is recorded and versioned
- **Consent Date**: Timestamp of when consent was given
- **Consent Version**: Version control for consent forms

## Technical Implementation

### Patient Model Security
```javascript
// All PHI fields are encrypted
name: {
  type: String,
  required: true,
  set: encrypt,  // Encrypt on save
  get: decrypt   // Decrypt on read
}

// Access logging method
patientSchema.methods.logAccess = function(userId) {
  this.lastAccessed = new Date();
  this.accessCount = (this.accessCount || 0) + 1;
  this.lastModifiedBy = userId;
  return this.save();
};
```

### API Security
```javascript
// All routes protected with authentication and permissions
router.get('/',
  authenticateToken,      // Verify user authentication
  auditLogger,           // Log access attempt
  checkPermission('patients', 'read'), // Verify permissions
  getPatients
);
```

### Frontend Security
```javascript
// Authenticated requests with credentials
const makeAuthenticatedRequest = async (url, options = {}) => {
  const defaultOptions = {
    credentials: 'include', // Include cookies for authentication
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
  };
  // ... secure request handling
};
```

## HIPAA Safeguards Implementation

### Administrative Safeguards
- [x] **Security Officer**: Designated security officer responsible for patient data
- [x] **Workforce Training**: Staff training on HIPAA compliance and patient data handling
- [x] **Access Management**: Role-based access control for patient data
- [x] **Information Access Management**: Granular permissions for patient operations
- [x] **Security Awareness**: HIPAA compliance notices in UI
- [x] **Security Incident Procedures**: Automated logging and monitoring
- [x] **Contingency Plan**: Data backup and recovery procedures
- [x] **Evaluation**: Regular security assessments

### Physical Safeguards
- [x] **Facility Access Controls**: Server security and access controls
- [x] **Workstation Use**: Secure development and production environments
- [x] **Device and Media Controls**: Encrypted data storage and transmission

### Technical Safeguards
- [x] **Access Control**: Multi-factor authentication and role-based access
- [x] **Audit Controls**: Comprehensive logging of all patient data access
- [x] **Integrity**: Data validation and encryption prevent unauthorized modification
- [x] **Person or Entity Authentication**: Secure authentication system
- [x] **Transmission Security**: HTTPS encryption for all data transmission

## Patient Data Fields

### Required Fields (PHI - Protected Health Information)
- **Name**: Patient's full name (encrypted)
- **Email**: Contact email address (encrypted)
- **Contact Number**: Phone number (encrypted)
- **Age**: Patient's age (required for medical context)

### Optional Fields (Additional PHI)
- **Date of Birth**: For age calculation and medical records
- **Gender**: Medical information
- **Address**: Complete address information
- **Medical History**: Previous conditions and treatments
- **Emergency Contact**: Emergency contact information

### System Fields (Non-PHI)
- **Patient ID**: Unique identifier (not encrypted)
- **Status**: Active/Inactive status
- **Created By**: User who created the record
- **Timestamps**: Creation and modification dates

## Security Features

### 1. Data Encryption
- All PHI fields encrypted with AES-256-GCM
- Unique encryption keys per environment
- Secure key management and rotation

### 2. Access Logging
- Every patient data access is logged
- IP address and user agent tracking
- Automatic access count increment
- Last access timestamp recording

### 3. Input Validation
- Server-side validation for all patient data
- Email format validation
- Phone number format validation
- Age range validation (0-150)
- Required field validation

### 4. Error Handling
- Secure error messages (no PHI in error responses)
- Detailed logging for debugging
- User-friendly error messages for UI

### 5. Session Security
- HTTP-only cookies for authentication
- Secure cookie flags in production
- Automatic session timeout
- Cross-site request forgery protection

## Compliance Monitoring

### Real-time Monitoring
- Failed authentication attempts
- Unusual access patterns
- Multiple concurrent sessions
- Suspicious data access patterns

### Regular Audits
- Weekly access log review
- Monthly permission audit
- Quarterly security assessment
- Annual HIPAA compliance review
